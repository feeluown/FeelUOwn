    **What is FM mode?**

    In FM mode, playlist's playback_mode is unchangeable, it will
    always be sequential. When playlist has no more song,
    the playlist hopes someone(we call it ``FMPlaylist`` here) will:
    1. catch the ``eof_reached`` signal
    2. add news songs to playlist by using ``fm_add`` method
    3. call ``next`` method to resume the player

    **How to enter FM mode?**

    Only FMPlaylist can(should) make playlist enter FM mode, it should
    do following things:
    1. clear the playlist
    2. change playlist mode to FM
    3. add several songs to playlist
    4. resume the player with the first song

    **When will playlist exit FM mode?**

    If user manually play a song, playlist will exit FM mode, at the
    same time, playlist will:
    1. clear itself
    2. change to normal mode
    3. set current song to the song
